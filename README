FangFS is a FUSE-based encrypted filesystem using libsodium.

Why?
====

A few reasons.

1. File systems, especially encrypted file systems, do not belong in the
   kernel.

2. Using libsodium primitives such as salsa20 are more secure and
   yield higher performance than older choices.

3. Using FUSE allows us to make encrypted file systems more usable.

4. Because FangFS uses FUSE, it is operating-system and filesystem-agnostic,
   and should work on any platform supported by both FUSE and libsodium.

5. Certain other FUSE-based encrypted filesystem services are plagued
   by poor use of cryptographic constructions.

Should I use this?
==================

GOSH no.  This is an experiment---nothing more.

Repeated: DO NOT USE for serious business.  FangFS may devour you alive!
